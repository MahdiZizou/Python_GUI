# Python_GUI
In this section, we learn how to make Graphical User Interface in Python by PyQt module :)

In main.py there are 6 examples getting deeper to PyQt step by step.

Also, it is explained how to couple Qt Creator and python. In Qt Creator, we can design any desired interface using User interface environment. So, instead of programming in python, we can use Qt Creator to design more easily. The output of Qt Creator is a .ui file so place main.py and sample .ui files in a same folder and try to play with the code to learn how to couple them. 

Good luck and enjoy this nice capability of Pyhon...
